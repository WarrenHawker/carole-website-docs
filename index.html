            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                All the artwork for the <a href="#">Carole Tongue website</a> is managed by a system called <strong>"Contentful"</strong>. 
                This gives you a place to add, edit, unpublish and delete artwork with no coding required. 
                In this guide we will go through all the different things you can do on <strong>"Contentful"</strong> and how 
                it affects how the artwork looks on the main website.

            <h1>Add new media</h1>
            <p>
                The images for any new pieces of artwork need to be added as media before they can appear on the main website. 
                This can either be done as you create the new artwork entries (see below) or ahead of time by adding media. 
                To add new media, go to the <strong>Media</strong> tab at the top on the screen. You should now see all the 
                images that have currently been uploaded.  
            </p>
            <div class="img-container">

                </div>
                <p>
                    To add new media, click the <strong>Add Asset</strong> button, then select either "single asset" to 
                    upload one image at a time, or "multiple assets" to upload multiple images at once.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Adding a single media piece lets you give it a specific title and description. These are optional
                    and won't be displayed on the main website (they are for your reference only). If you choose not to 
                    give a title, it will use the same title as the file name.

                        Inside the "File(required)" box, click the <strong>Open file selector</strong> button. 
                        From here you can select an image from a number of different sources, including your PC, Facebook, Instagram, etc..
                        Or drag'n'drop images directly into the window
                    </p>

                        for altering the image if you aren't happy with it. If you wish to use a different image, click the "delete file" button
                        and choose a different file as before.

                On the following page, provide a Title, Description (optional), image, created on(date) and category. These settings will 
                define how the artwork is displayed on the main website. 
            </p>
            <p>NOTES:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Description will only appear on the page for the individual artwork on the main website. If you don't provide a Description for the artwork, 
                    this section will be blank.

                    To add an image, click the <strong>Add media</strong> button and then either select "Add existing media" or "Add new media".

                            or any other published work.  
                        </li>

                <li>
                    Any category you select will cause the artwork piece to show up in that category section on the main website. If you select multiple categories
                    your artwork will show up in those multiple categories on the main website.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    The slug is the web address for the individual page for that specific artwork, and is based on the title of the piece. 
                    For example if the slug is "Joy", the address for that individual piece will be 
                    <strong>https://carole-website-contentful.vercel.app/art/joy</strong>
                    <ul>

                </li>
                <li>
                    The final setting is <strong>front page image</strong>. Selecting "yes" here will cause the image to show up on the front page of the main website.
                    <strong>However, if you have selected "yes" on multiple pieces of artwork, only ONE of them will appear on the front page.</strong>
