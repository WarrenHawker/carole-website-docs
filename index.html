            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                All the artwork for the <a href="#">Carole Tongue website</a> is managed by a system called <strong>"Contentful"</strong>. 
                This gives you a place to add, edit, unpublish and delete artwork with no coding required. 
                In this guide we will go through all the different things you can do on <strong>"Contentful"</strong> and how 
                it affects how the artwork looks on the main website.

            <h1>Add new Media</h1>
            <p>
                The images for any new pieces of artwork need to be added as media before they can appear on the main website. 
                This can either be done as you create the new artwork entries (see below) or ahead of time by adding media. 
                To add new media, go to the <strong>Media</strong> tab at the top on the screen. You should now see all the 
                images that have currently been uploaded.  
            </p>
            <!-- image here -->
            <p>
                To add new media, click the <strong>Add Asset</strong> button, then select either "single asset" to 
                upload one image at a time, or "multiple assets" to upload multiple images at once.
            </p>
            <!-- image here -->
            <article class="single-media">
                <p>
                    Adding a single media piece lets you give it a specific title and description. These are optional
                    and don't be displayed on the main website (they are for your reference only). If you choose not to 
                    give a title, it will use the same title as the file name.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inside the "File(required)" box, click the <strong>Open file selector</strong> button. 
                    From here you can select an image from a number of different sources, including your PC, Facebook, Instagram, etc..
                    Or drag'n'drop images directly into the window
                </p>
                 <!-- image here -->
                 <p>
                    Once you've chosen your image, a preview of it will appear in the box. Below the box there are a number of options 
                    for altering the image if you aren't happy with it. If you wish to use a different image, click the "delete file" button
                    and choose a different file as before.
                 </p>
                 <!-- image here -->
                 <p> 
                    Once you are happy with your image, click the green <strong>Publish</strong> button on the right hand side to 
                    save your work. 
                 </p>
            </article>
            <article class="multiple-media">
                <p>
                    When adding multiple media pieces, the titles will be the same as the file names.
                    Inside the popup box, select the media pieces from your chosen source, or drag'n'drop them directly into the window. 
                </p>
                 <!-- image here -->
                 <p>
                    Clicking on the "edit" button next to an image will allow you to edit the image by cropping or rotating it. 
                 </p>
                 <!-- image here -->
                 <p>
                    To remove an image from the selection, click the "X" button next to the image you want to remove. 
                 </p>
                 <!-- image here -->
                 <p>
                    Once you're happy with all the images, click the <strong>Upload</strong> button to save your work. 
                 </p>
